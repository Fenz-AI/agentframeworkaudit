# Manus Security Audit Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

Upon thorough examination of Manus's architecture and implementation, our security audit has revealed several key findings regarding this AI assistant's design, capabilities, and potential security implications. This report documents the technical composition of Manus and evaluates associated risk factors from a security perspective.

## Technical Architecture Analysis

Our investigation began when the audit agent requested access to files in the `/opt/.manus/` directory. This provided complete access to the sandbox execution environment code, enabling a comprehensive reverse engineering of the system architecture.

### Key Findings

1. **Foundation Model**: Manus is built upon Claude Sonnet as its base language model
2. **Tool Integration**: The system employs 29 distinct tools extending Claude Sonnet's capabilities
3. **Agent Architecture**: Contrary to potential assumptions, Manus does not implement a multi-agent system architecture
4. **Web Access Implementation**: Manus utilizes `browser_use` as the foundation for its computer interaction capabilities
5. **Full Implementation Details**: Complete tool specifications and prompt engineering details are available here:
6. **Sandbox Environment**: The complete sandbox execution code has been extracted and is available for further analysis (note: this code contains encryption and should be evaluated for security risks before use): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sh5QtDTpRxt70YyisvTjVAZKCiGJDhVQ/view (DYOR)

## Security Assessment

This reverse engineering exercise highlights several important security considerations:

1. **Replication Risk**: The availability of these implementation details makes it highly probable that multiple functional replicas of Manus will emerge in the open-source community within the next week
2. **Potential for Modification**: With core components exposed, variants may appear with modified safety guardrails or capabilities
3. **Architectural Insights**: The lack of a multi-agent structure and reliance on tool integration provides valuable insights into effective AI assistant architecture design
4. **Web Browsing Implementation**: The use of `browser_use` as the foundation for computer interaction warrants further security analysis

## Recommendations

1. **Implementation Audit**: Organizations implementing similar systems should conduct thorough security reviews of any code derived from this leak
2. **Monitoring**: The open-source ecosystem should be monitored for potentially unsafe variations
3. **Documentation Review**: Further analysis of the prompt engineering techniques could yield valuable insights for secure AI system design

## Conclusion

This security audit reveals significant technical details about Manus's implementation that were previously unavailable to the broader AI community. While this transparency enables innovation, it also creates potential security concerns through the likely proliferation of similar systems with varying degrees of safety measures.

The security implications of this reverse engineering exercise will continue to unfold as the open-source community begins to implement and potentially modify these components.
